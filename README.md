# Imperio
Strategy game inspired by *Age of Empires* built in Java and Swing. The game features a tile-based game map, tower defense mechanics, resource management and simple combat. The game ends when the player defeats 5 enemies.
#### Controls/Interface
Use mouse to navigate the interface. Left click selects a unit and right click moves to the selected tile, or use WASD keys to move. When selecting a villager, the X key can be used to collect the resource located in the current tile. A menu appears when selecting a building that can make new units. Resources are shown on the right panel. Combat units automatically attack enemies on adjacent tiles.
